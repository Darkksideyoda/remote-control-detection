# remote-control-detection :control_knobs:
Remote Control Devices analysis and Detection with Image Processing and Computer Vision Techniques
### Goals
- Controlling Whether Users Send Remote Control or Another Image to the System in the Infrastructure to be Established in the Future.

- If the Sent Image is a Remote Control, Detection Without Asking the User How Many Buttons There Are.

### Working Principle

- I ran and tested the project in Python 3.7.6 in Conda. :snake:
